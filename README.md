## Features

* Unity versions detection on build agents
* Unity build runner with smart completions
* Automatic discovery of Unity build steps
* Unity Editor tests reporting
* Unity build settings feature

### Unity build settings feature

This [TeamCity build feature](https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/TCDL/Adding+Build+Features) allows to **automatically activate and return Unity Editor license** before build start and after build completion.

Also it allows to configure **Unity cache server** address in one place to use this setting within Unity build steps. 

# Download

You can [download the plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/11453-unity-support) and install it as [an additional TeamCity plugin](https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/TCDL/Installing+Additional+Plugins).

# Compatibility

The plugin is compatible with [TeamCity](https://www.jetbrains.com/teamcity/download/) 2018.1+ and was verified to work with Unity 2017+.

# Configuration

The plugin searches for Unity installations in `PATH` variable and in the following directories:
* macOS: `/Applications/Unity*` and `/Applications/Unity/Hub/Editor/*`
* Linux: `/opt/Unity*`/`~/Unity*` and `/opt/Unity/Hub/Editor/*`/`~/Unity/Hub/Editor/*`
* Windows: `%Program Files%/Unity*` and `%Program Files%/Unity/Hub/Editor/*`

To add Unity installation located in custom path you could use `UNITY_HOME` environment variable. Multiple paths could be specified by using [default path delimiter](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/io/File.html#separator).

All detected Unity versions will be reported as build agent configuration parameters with the `unity.path.%unityVersion%` prefix.

# Build

This project uses Gradle as the build system. You can easily open it in [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/help/importing-project-from-gradle-model.html) or [Eclipse](http://gradle.org/eclipse/).
